# DataStructures

You are now reading the instructions to use the files uploaded to this repository.

## SOME CONSIDERATIONS

All of the files present here have been coded in the Windows OS, therefore, there might be some unpexpected errors when running them in any other OS. 

## HOW TO RUN THE FILES?

You will find a .c file for each data structure. So, for example, when trying the graph data structure file you'll have to run the "GrafoDataStructure.c" file as shown below: 

```sh
<...>gcc GrafoDataStructure.c -o grafo
```
This will creat an .exe file with the name given after "-o". To run it, just type the name and press enter:

```sh
<...>grafo

/* CONTENT OF THE FILE */

```
